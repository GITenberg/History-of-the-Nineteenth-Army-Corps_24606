description: Details the regimental history of the Union Army's XIX Corps, Department
  of the Gulf, created in 1862 comprised totally of men then occupying Louisiana and
  Eastern Texas. The XIX Corps fought mainly in Louisiana, but took part in the Red
  River Campaign and Sheridan's Shenandoah Campaign where they suffered heavy losses
  at Opequon. From there, they were sent to Savannah where the majority were mustered
  out in March of 1865. The appendix covers rosters, losses in battle, officers killed
  or mortally wounded, Port Hudson forlorn hope, articles of capitulation, and note
  on Early's strength.
